# Palindrome Checker

## Overview

The Palindrome Checker is a web application designed to check if a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters reads the same backward as forward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. It's a great tool for those learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Key Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to enter any text to check for palindrome properties.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Gives immediate results on whether the input is a palindrome.
- **Text Sanitization**: Automatically removes non-alphanumeric characters and adjusts text casing for accurate checking.
- **Interactive Design**: Simple and responsive user interface, enhancing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the palindrome checking logic and interactivity.

## Learning Outcomes

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Practice with strings, arrays, and regular expressions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with web page elements dynamically.
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions like button clicks and text input.
- **Responsive Design**: Creating a layout that works on various screen sizes and devices.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter the text in the input field and click 'Check' to see if it's a palindrome.
